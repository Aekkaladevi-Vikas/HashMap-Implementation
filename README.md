# HashMap Implementation in Java

## Overview

This project is a custom implementation of a HashMap data structure in Java. It provides a basic understanding of how HashMaps work under the hood, including the handling of collisions and dynamic resizing.

## Features

- **Key-Value Storage**: Store and retrieve values based on unique keys.
- **Collision Handling**: Implements separate chaining to handle collisions.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically resizes the internal array when the load factor threshold is reached.
- **Basic Operations**: Supports basic operations such as `put`, `get`, `remove`, `containsKey`and`keySet`.
